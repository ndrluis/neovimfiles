# vimfiles

My neovim configuration, tested on OSX

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/ndrluis/neovimfiles.git
    $ cd neovimfiles && ./setup.sh

## Other features

* Deletes trailing spaces by default when saving files
* Fixed swap / backup / undo dir to keep Guards sane

## Key mappings

Please note that the leader key is currently mapped to `,`

### Custom

* `<Space><Space>` to maximize buffer
* `<Space>=` to restore buffer
